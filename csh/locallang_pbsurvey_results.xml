			<label index=".description">Questionaire results.</label>
			<label index=".details">Contains all results from the questionaire, even if they are not finished.</label>
			<label index="_.seeAlso">tx_pbsurvey_item</label>
			<label index="hidden.description">Use this to temporarily exclude this result from display and export to csv file with the module Web &gt; Questionaire.</label>
			<label index="hidden.details">Setting this option is practical when exporting the results to a csv file. You can, for instance, exclude this result that was meant for testing purposes only.</label>
			<label index="user.description">The name of the frontend user who participated in the questionaire.</label>
			<label index="user.details">When a questionaire has been taken among logged-in frontend users, the user who participated will be displayed here.
			
When a questionaire has been taken anonymously, this field will be empty.
	
This field will be used by the module &quot;Web &gt; Questionaire&quot; to extract the users personal information from the table &quot;fe_users&quot; and insert this information in the csv file.</label>
			<label index="_user.seeAlso">fe_users</label>
			<label index="ip.description">The IP Address where the user was located when doing this survey.</label>
			<label index="ip.details">The IP Address can be used for demographic information. In some cases it is used by Questionaire to compare access rights of the survey.</label>
			<label index="finished.description">Checked if the user finished the survey.</label>
			<label index="finished.details">The result record is always made in the beginning of a survey, when the user sends the form of the first page back to the website. At the end of the survey this flag will be checked. This flag is important to make a difference between finished and unfinished surveys when exporting the results or generating backend statistics.</label>
			<label index="begintstamp.description">The start date and time of this result.</label>
			<label index="begintstamp.details">At the beginning of a survey the start time and date is written to the result record. At the end the end date and time is written to the record. With these two values you can determine how long it took for users to participate in the survey.
			
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When the survey is updatable it is possible there is a strange difference between the start and end time. The start date can be later then the end date. This is because a user updated his own answers but didn't finish the update session.</label>			
			<label index="endtstamp.description">The end date and time of this result.</label>
			<label index="endtstamp.details">At the end of a survey the end time and date is written to the result record. At the beginning the start date and time is written to the record. With these two values you can determine how long it took for users to participate in the survey.
